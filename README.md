## Key Takeaways
üí° **Memory granularity matters**: Turn-level, session-level & summarization-based memory struggle with retrieval accuracy and the semantic integrity or relevance of the context.

üí° **Prompt compression methods** (e.g., [LLMLingua-2](https://llmlingua.com/llmlingua2.html)) **can denoise memory retrieval**, boosting both **retrieval accuracy** and **response quality.**

‚úÖ **SeCom** ‚Äì an approach that **segments conversations topically** for memory construction and performs memory retrieval based on compressed memory units.

üìä **Result** ‚Äì superior performance on long-term conversation benchmarks such as LOCOMO and Long-MT-Bench+!

## Install

```bash
pip install llmlingua
pip install -e .
```

SeCom uses [dot_env](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) to manage the API_KEY.

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

Specifiy your OPENAI_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_BASE in `~/dot_env/openai.env`

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
OPENAI_API_BASE=""
```

## Usage

```python

from secom import SeCom

memory_manager = SeCom(granularity="segment")

conversation_history = [
    [
        "First session of a very looooooong conversation history",
        "The second user-bot turn of the first session",
    ],
    ["Second Session ..."],
]
requests = ["A question regarding the conversation history", "Another question"]
result = memory_manager.get_memory(
    requests, conversation_history, compress_rate=0.9, retrieve_topk=1
)
print(result["retrieved_texts"])
# >>>
```
